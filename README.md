# Python `Django` Web App

In my honest opinion, learning Python by building apps/creating projects remains the best way to learn it.

In this project, using the Python Django web framework, I will create a web app called Learning Log that allows users to
log the topics theyâ€™re interested in and to make journal entries
as they learn about each topic.

The Learning Log home page
would describe the site and invite users to either register or log
in. Once logged in, a user should be able to create new topics,
add new entries, and read and edit existing entries
